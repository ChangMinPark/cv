\Entry
\textbf{End-to-End System Protecting Integrity of Images Across Social Media} 
(in Progress)
\Gap
\BulletItem
Implemented a system embedding an \underline{invisible hash watermark} into raw 
pixels, checking whether the image has been tampered in the middle, and 
recovering the tampered areas using \underline{error-correction code}.
\BulletItem
Leveraged (1) \underline{Google SafetyNet} to protect an image acquisition path 
on an image producer's device and (2) \underline{digital certificates} to 
simplify key sharing for integrity check. 

\vspace{1ex}
\Entry
\textbf{Securely Displaying Static and Animated Images Using TrustZone} 
(Published in MobiSys `21)
\Gap
\BulletItem
Implemented a system protecting image display from the compromised OS using 
\underline{ARM TrustZone}.
\BulletItem
Leveraged (1) \underline{IPU's multiple display channels} to enable simultaneous 
displaying from both untrusted and trusted domains, (2) \underline{ChaCha20}, 
a fast stream cipher, to provide frame rates around or higher than 30 FPS, 
and (3) \underline{visual cryptography} to provide an alternative to regular 
cryptography.

\vspace{1ex}
\Entry
\textbf{Mapping UI Events to Gestures and Voice Commands} 
(Published in EICS ‘19, PACM­HCI, Best Paper)
\Gap
\BulletItem
Implemented a system enabling task automation for Android apps with gestures 
and voice commands. 
\BulletItem
Leveraged (1) \underline{bytecode instrumentation} tool to analyze an app and 
to inject functionality without the need for source code and 
(2) \underline{UI record-and-replay} technique to record a sequence of UI 
actions and later replay it with a mapped gesture or voice command.


\vspace{1ex}
\Entry
\textbf{UI Compatibility Testing System for Android Apps} 
(Published in ICSE ‘19)
\Gap
\BulletItem
Implemented a system automatically comparing the UI behavior of an app across 
different devices, different Android versions, and different app versions.
\BulletItem
Detected various \underline{forward and backward compatibility} issues on 
thousands of apps on Google Play in a short period of time by building a 
\underline{parallel testing} strategy and a \underline{programming model} for 
scripting it.


\vspace{1ex}
\Entry
\textbf{Enabling API Virtualization on Android for Platform Openness} 
(Published in MobiSys ‘17)
\Gap
\BulletItem
Implemented a system allowing third-party developers to modify, instrument, or 
extend platform API calls and deploy their modifications seamlessly. 
\BulletItem
Leveraged \underline{bytecode instrumentation} tool to enables modifications 
completely at the app layer without requiring any platform-level changes.
