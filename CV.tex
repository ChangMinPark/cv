\BulletItem
\textbf{Rushmore} [Under submission] is a system that securely displays static or animated images 
using TrustZone. The core functionality of Rushmore is to securely decrypt and display encrypted 
images from a trusted party on a mobile device.

\BulletItem
\textbf{Gesto} [EICS `19, PACM-HCI, Best Paper Honorable Mention] is a system that enables task 
automation for Android apps using gestures 
and voice commands. Using this system, a user can record a UI action sequence for an app, 
choose a gesture or a voice command to activate the UI action sequence, and later trigger 
the UI action sequence by the corresponding gesture/voice command.

\textbf{Mimic} [ICSE `19] is an automated UI compatibility testing system for Android apps. 
Mimic is designed specifically for comparing the UI behavior of an app across different 
devices, different Android versions, and different app versions.

\textbf{Reptor} [MobiSys `17] enables open innovation in mobile platforms. Our technique allows third-party 
developers to modify, instrument, or extend platform API calls and deploy their modifications 
seamlessly. The uniqueness of our technique is that it enables modifications completely at 
the app layer without requiring any platform-level changes.
